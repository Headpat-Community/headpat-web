          The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
          distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
          country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
          regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
          within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
          choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
          initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws,
          if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
          regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
          (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.),
          so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not
          use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would
          violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

            These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws
            of Germany, and the use of the United Nations Convention of

            consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by
            obligatory provisions of the law in your country to residence.
            Headpat and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive
            jurisdiction of the courts of Lower Saxony, which means that you may
            make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to
            these Legal Terms in Germany, or in the EU country in which you
            reside.
